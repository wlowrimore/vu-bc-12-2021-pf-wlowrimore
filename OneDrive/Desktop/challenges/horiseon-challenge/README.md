#CODE CHALLENGE: REFRACTOR

Refractored existing code to make the site more accessible. Found and fixed any broken links, while respecting the Scout Rule. Consolidated CSS selectors and their properties to eliminate any unneccesary blocks of code.  Organized the selectors so as to follow the flow of the semantic structure of the HTML elements. Included comments for each element and/or section of the page, making it easier to locate specific areas for potential updates and/or fixes.
