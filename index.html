          <p>My name is William Lowrimore.  Originally from Memphis, TN, I have spent a majority
             of my professional life as an established musician.  I have toured and recorded with 
             various artists.  On my down time I turned to instructing music theory to budding
             musicians of all ages.  As my family tree is comprised of successful music artists
             and computer software "techies", it was only a matter of time before I lept into a 
             world of software development.  I recently transplanted my roots, just up the "Music 
             Highway" to Nashville, TN.  Here in Nashville, I decided to take that leap and enroll 
             in Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp.  With 20+ years of experience in music 
             theory mathematics, creative composition, and the ability to convey these teachings, 
             I felt as though software development was the next stop on my journey.  I am currently
             "deep diving" into HTML, CSS and Git as I work toward a Full Stack Developer Certification.
             Next stop...JavaScript. And from there...THE SKY'S THE LIMIT!
