# William Lowrimore Portfolio

## Challenge 2

This is the first installment of my Portfolio, which I have completed as part of my curriculum for the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp.  This page was built using HTML and CSS / Advanced CSS in VSCode.  The layout was loosely based off of an example provided to students by staff.  It includes in-page hyper-links, as well as links opening contents outside of the page.  I used the "target= '_blank' syntax so that the outside links are viewed in a new window. I also used the "rel= 'noreferrer'" syntax to avoid any hazards of phishing or scam sites redirection.  In the case that the images cannot load (or a screenreader is being used), I included the "alt" tag for a brief explanation of the contents of the image(s).  The two examples of "My Work" are previous assignments complete during the course of bootcamp.  I used variables in the style.css file (for cleaner/faster organization), as well as, media queries for responsive design to be displayed at different viewpoints.  Finally, I utilized GIT bash to add, commit, and push the files to my repository, which can be found on my GitHub Page.
